How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It help me identify what had changed between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Compare current buggy version to previous working version.
Going back to previous version if the current version is not working.
Tracking who has worked on which version and what has changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manual commits give more control to programming team.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Thats great!!!
